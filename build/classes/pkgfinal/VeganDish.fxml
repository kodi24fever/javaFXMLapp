The soybean industry is causing widespread deforestation and displacement of small farmers and indigenous peoples around the globe.&#10;3. Apples and other tree fruit crops inherently have a minimal environmental footprint, says David Granatstein, WSU sustainable agriculture specialist.  To grow apples, you could simply plant a seed, water it from a bucket as necessary, remove weeds by hand for the first few years, pick the fruit, and throw away the core. In fact, the process &#10;4. Processing 800 gallons of maple sap takes approximately 60 gallons of oil or a cord of wood to produce 20 gallons of finished syrup. These costs for using non-renewable energy sources such as oil and the resulting pollution are very high. The Colorado Department of Health and Environment, Air Pollution Control Division states, &quot;Burning wood &#10;5. What the farmers are ignoring is the harmful effect of ginger cultivation on the environment. Ginger is prone to rhizome rot viral disease. Since farmers do not want to risk crop failure, they use large quantities of chemicals—pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and fertilisers—to prevent crop diseases and increase yield. &#10;6. Importation of garlic from China or California contributes to carbon emissions because of the transportation by boat, plane, or truck.&#10;7. Carbon emissions from the transport of red peppers from around the world.&#10;8. Currently, water is readily available in Miami. In other parts of the world, fresh clean water is hard to come by. As climate change continues the availability of fresh water will drop.&#10;9. When grown using traditional methods, both sweetpotato and yam are widely considered to be environmentally friendly, relative to cereal crops. They are easily inter-cropped and do not require a complete clearing of forest for planting, and are thus amenable to agro-forestry and other relatively sustainable land-use strategies. &#10;10. Bell pepper production involves the use of pesticides, which can be especially harmful to natural water sources as the toxins in the pesticides runoff from farms into rivers and lakes.&#10;11. In general, the environmental impact of coconut oil is very low. However, as demand for coconut oil and coconut water has skyrocketed, coastal mangroves, which are essential ecosystems for animals and provide natural storm protection, are being cleared for coconut monocrops, which are low in biodiversity, deplete the soil.&#10;12. Transportation of cumin from foreign countries produces a lot of carbon emissions.&#10;13. Environmentally, sea salt collection can be a low-impact operation. Unfortunately, some companies manage to find ways to increase the impact by trucking loads long distances or speeding up the evaporation process by using fossil fuel-based energy.&#10;14. Rice requires double or triple the amount of water as the other cereal crops to produce the same dry weight. &#10;15. It is common for crops to be sprayed with pesticides, but to combat this environmental issue you can buy organic green onions which are grown without pesticides.&#10;16. Cilantro can be easily grown in home gardens, reducing the environmental impacts from transporting the crop from out of state.&#10;17. 1kg of peanuts produces 2.88kg of CO2 emissions&#10;18. Sriracha is sold in plastic containers which are not environmentally friendly." />

Roast the vegetables: On a large, rimmed baking sheet, toss the sweet potato with a generous tablespoon of coconut oil, the cumin and a sprinkle of salt. Arrange them in a single layer, and set. &#9;&#10;2. On a separate, smaller baking sheet, toss the bell pepper with about 1 teaspoon of coconut oil and a sprinkle of salt. Toss until lightly coated, and arrange them in a single layer.&#10;3. Roast the sweet potatoes on the middle rack for about 35 minutes, tossing halfway, and roast the peppers on the top rack for about 20 minutes, tossing halfway. The vegetables will be tender and caramelized on the edges when they are ready.&#10;4. In the meantime, cook the rice: Once the water is boiling, pour in the rice and give it a stir. Boil the rice for 30 minutes, then turn off the heat and drain the rice. Return the rice to the pot and cover the pot. Let the rice steam that way for 10 minutes. Remove the lid, fluff the rice with a fork and season with salt to taste.&#10;5. Make the sauce: In a bowl, whisk together the sauce ingredients. If the sauce is too thick or too spicy, whisk in a little more water.&#10;6. Serve: In bowls, divide the rice and roasted vegetables. Drizzle each bowl generously with sauce, and top with a sprinkle of green onions, cilantro and peanuts." />
